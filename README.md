# ThesisProject
My bachelor thesis project oriented on the research of Linked Data and DBpedia queries. 

The code is really messy (was pressed by time) most of the effort was oriented towards making the queries
return appropriate results and finding decently working DBpedia endpoints.

I plan to rewrite the application using a different backend language (probably NodeJs), with much cleaner code and
hopefully more advanced features.
